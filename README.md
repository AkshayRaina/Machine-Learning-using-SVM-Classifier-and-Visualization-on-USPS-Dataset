Machine Learning using SVM Classifier and Visualization on USPS Dataset

Getting started with USPS dataset

Handwitten Digits USPS dataset has has 7291 train and 2007 test images. The images are 16*16 grayscale pixels.

The dataset is given in hdf5 file format, the hdf5 file has two groups train and test and each group has two datasets: data and target.

Demonstration of how to load USPS dataset, visualize and build a linear SVM classifier on it and predict accuracy.
