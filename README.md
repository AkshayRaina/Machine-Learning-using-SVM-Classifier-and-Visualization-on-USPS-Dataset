Machine Learning using SVM Classifier and Visualization on USPS Dataset

## Getting started with USPS dataset

[Handwitten Digits USPS dataset](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/291440/) has 7291 train and 2007 test images. The images are 16*16 grayscale pixels.

The dataset is given in [hdf5 file format](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), the hdf5 file has two groups train and test and each group has two datasets: data and target.

### Demonstration of how to load USPS dataset, visualize and build a linear SVM classifier on it and predict accuracy.
